title: Hugo minimal example
author: Victor Klos

What you see is a single-page minimal example for [Hugo](hugo). It was inspired
by the discussion on the desire to have a [minimal default theme](issue_default_theme).
Except that I don't want a minimal theme, only a minimal example.

It features:

- templates
- base templates
- blocks
- default blocks
- static css

That is no theme, no menu, no tags, no categories, only the very basics.

Well ok, it does have a shortcode:

<!-- {{< youtube pjS4pOLyB7c >}} -->

Enjoy!
